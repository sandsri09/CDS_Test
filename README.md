Test Performance Scenario

Website: http://automationpractice.com/index.php
We would like you to start generating a performance pack for our website as indicated above. The tool we would like to use is JMeter for the performance testing. Some statistics on what we would like to cover are:
•	Traffic:
o	Average 100 to 500 users
o	Peak 1000 to 2000 users
•	Throughput
o	Average 50 to 250 submissions an hour
o	Peak 500 to 1000 submissions an hour
We are confident in executing performance scripts, but we require some help with the following tasks.
1.	Where would be best to performance test for the site and what to encompass in the scripts?
2.	What further questions would you have on the above statistics?
3.	Write performance tests for 3 of the parts of the site as indicated in the prior question.
4.	Setup a Git Hub repository for the JMeter scripts and send over a link for access.
Note:We Only require the scripts to be scripted no execution to be done.
Your submission should be in the form of a git hub repository that you can give us access to so that we can pull down what you have done and review.
